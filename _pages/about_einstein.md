Hey, everyone!

I am Nithya, and I am currently pursuing a degree in Data Science at Michigan State University. Born in Royal Oak, Michigan, I spent the first nine years of my life in Lake Orion before eventually settling in Novi. Growing up with parents who work in the field of STEM, I developed a keen interest in building a future within this domain. 

As an undergraduate, I have gained a foundational understanding of the principles in data analysis and coding. Through my coursework, I was able to apply a multitude of techniques in programming languages such as Python, R Studio, and C ++. These experiences have enabled me to derive insights from many different perspectives and make well-informed conclusions.

Beyond my academic endeavors, I hold a great passion for the arts and beauty. I have a love for classical styles of art and I aspire to incorporate it in my daily life. This may involve studying the applications of it in literature, music, and paintings. This enables my desire to create a kind of work that is inspired by the beauty and spirit in classical art.
